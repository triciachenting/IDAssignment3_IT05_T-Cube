# IDAssignment3_IT05_T-Cube
Website is available [here](https://triciachenting.github.io/IDAssignment3_IT05_T-Cube/html/index.html)  
Our project was inspired by the rise in the number of alzheimer's disease and dementia patients.  
Research has shown that playing memory games like these "Memory Card game" and "Simon Game", helps to stimulate thinking and slows down the progression of the disease.  
We believe that our website would be beneficial for not only patients with alzheimer's or dementia, but also children, as these games can help to improve their brain functions, 
such as attention, concentration, and focus.  
These games can also help with stress relieve as it is both relaxing and stimulating at the same time.

## Design Proccess
We referenced our designs from available sources and made sure that they were not vulgar in any way.
We applied a dark colour background as we noticed the rise in the number of people using "dark mode" recently, it is also supposedly less harmful to human's eyesight.
